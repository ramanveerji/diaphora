###  Object File Boundary Detection in IDA Pro with Local Function Affinity  ###
################################################################################

# LFA Metric
# Local Function Affinity (LFA) is a measurement of the direction a function
# is being "pulled" by the functions it calls and the functions that call it.
# By looking at an average of the log of the distance between these functions
# we get a measurement of whether the function is related to functions in the
# positive or negative direction.

# Edge Detection
# In a standard C/C++ development environment, the project is divided into
# multiple source files, which are compiled to object files, then linked into
# the final binary in order.  If external references are eliminated (LFA does
# this imperfectly by just eliminating calls whose distance is above a chosen
# threshold) we would expect to see LFA starting positive, switching to
# negative over the course of a source file, then switching back to positive
# at the beginning of the next file.  So object file boundaries 

# What is code anyway?
# Don't get too hung up on "object file boundaries" - for LFA (or any other
# attempt to solve the problem) to be perfect, the design and implementation
# of the code would have to be perfect.  What LFA is really finding is clusters
# of functionality, that should be more or less related to object files
# but it will often break up large object files into multiple clusters or
# detect 2 or 3 related object files as one file.
